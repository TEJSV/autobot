# Friend-Recommender
Friend Recommender System in Python (Networkx) using Facebook Dataset

In this project, we implemented the collaborative filtering method using Python's networkx. There are two methods to recommend a friend to anyone, the one is number of common friends method and other is recommend by influence method. Both methods are implemented and compared in their efficiency. 
The dataset used is Facebook_Dataset.txt consisting of across 4000 nodes and 8000 edges. Nodes represent people and edges represent the relationship of friends. 
The code reads facebook dataset, takes a user input of node then gives 10 recommendations for the user. 

The conclusion is that recommendation by influence is efficient and accurate. 

All other details, results and screenshots are included in the .pdf report.
